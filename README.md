# AbsenceEpilepsy_Experiment
This repository contains code that I used to run all my analysis for the absence epilepsy experiment.

This experiment forms part of my PhD thesis on the utility of multi-omics integration to identify molecular contributors of complex disorders. 

This project involves two main analysis; 
  (i) single- and multi-omics analysis with only proteomics and metabolomics across three different time points of absence epilepsy development, and
  (ii) multi-omics integration analysis with transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data in an adult rat model of absence epilepsy

For this experiment, the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and their Non-Epileptic Control (NEC) counterparts are included.

Time points include:
  (i) 3 weeks - before seizure development,
  (ii) 7 weeks - when seizures have just begun to develop, and
  (iii) 16 weeks - when seizures have fully developed
